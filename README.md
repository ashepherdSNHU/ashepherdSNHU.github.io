## Code Review

* In this section, I will review two code sources to exhibit my abilities to objectively critique code based on a set of prescribed standards in code review. I will provide an overall review of the code's purpose and its functionality. Then, I will review each piece code as it pertains to various aspects, such as code structure, documentation, formatting, etc. And finally, I will provide the identification of, and enhancements that will be performed to improve the code respective of the designated category

* First, the Student Grade project from the Foundations in Application Development course will be reviewed. This code source pertains to the category of **Software Design and Engineering** aspect of code development. 
For the next two sections, the Animal Shelter project from the Client/Server Development course will come under review. This code source will be used for both the **Algorithms and Data Structures** and the **Databases** categories. The only differing sections for this review will come in the last section, the identification and enhancements.
